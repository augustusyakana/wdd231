                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>The purpose of KamoraLink Lite is to simplify the job application process for both job seekers and
                    employers in the
                    Federated States of Micronesia by providing a digital platform that consolidates job opportunities
                    and applications in
                    one place. By reducing the need for hard copy submissions, KamoraLink Lite makes it easier, faster,
                    and more efficient
                    for job seekers to apply for positions and for employers to manage their hiring process, ultimately
                    bridging the gap
                    between both parties and promoting better access to employment opportunities.</p>
